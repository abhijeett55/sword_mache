Gameplay instructions
The â˜¥ represents you, and the arrow symbol next to you is your rusty sword.
Use arrow keys or WASD keys to move. Your sword will always point in the direction you are moving. (You are not particularly skilled at swordfighting, apparently).
Monsters will attempt to eat you. If they touch you, they will succeed and the game will be over.
Touching a monster with your rusty sword will instantly kill it (naturally, since monsters are unsafe).
Have fun!
